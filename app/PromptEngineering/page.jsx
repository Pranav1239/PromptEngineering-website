      <h1 className="text-4xl mt-4 cursor-default font-bold">Advantages of <span className="text-purple-600">Prompt Engineering</span></h1>
      <div>
      <li className="mt-4 font-light"><b className="font-extrabold">Greater flexibility:</b> Prompt engineering makes AI models more flexible by allowing users to use the same AI model to perform a variety of different tasks by using different prompts.</li>
      <li className="mt-4 font-light"><b className="font-extrabold">Improved accuracy and relevance:</b> Prompt engineering can help to improve the accuracy and relevance of the outputs of AI models by providing clear and specific instructions, and by using examples.</li>
      <li className="mt-4 font-light"><b className="font-extrabold">Greater control over the outputs:</b> Prompt engineering gives users more control over the outputs of AI models by allowing them to specify the desired style, tone, and content of the output.</li>
      <li className="mt-4 font-light"><b className="font-extrabold">Increased interpretability:</b> Prompt engineering can make the outputs of AI models more interpretable by allowing users to understand why the model generated the output that it did by understanding the prompt that was used.</li>
      <li className="mt-4 font-light"><b className="font-extrabold">Reduced bias:</b> Prompt engineering can help to reduce bias in AI models by avoiding the use of language that is biased towards certain groups or individuals.</li>

      <div>
      <li className="mt-4 font-light"><b className="font-extrabold">Prompt engineering will become more specialized.</b> As AI models are developed for specific tasks and domains, prompt engineering will become more specialized to meet the needs of these models and domains. For example, there will be prompt engineers who specialize in crafting prompts for AI models that generate creative text formats, translate languages, or write different kinds of creative content.</li>
      <li className="mt-4 font-light"><b className="font-extrabold">Prompt engineering will become more automated. </b>As prompt engineering becomes more specialized and complex, there will be a growing need for tools and techniques to automate the process. This will make prompt engineering more accessible to a wider range of users and enable them to get the most out of AI models.</li>
      <li className="mt-4 font-light"><b className="font-extrabold">Prompt engineering will play a key role in the development of new AI applications. </b>As AI becomes more integrated into our lives, there will be a growing need for AI applications that are tailored to the specific needs of individuals and organizations. Prompt engineering will play a key role in the development of these applications by enabling users to specify the desired functionality and behavior of the applications.</li>
